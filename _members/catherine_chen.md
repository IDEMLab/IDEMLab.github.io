Catherine received her B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics from UCLA and her M.S. from NYUâ€™s Center for Data Science. Her research interests focus on the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and episodic memory, with an emphasis on data-driven methods for understanding human memory and narrative recall. Outside of academics, she enjoys reading detective fiction, practicing film photography, and scrolling through far too many photos of her dog.
