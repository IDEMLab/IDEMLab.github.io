Catherine Chen is a master’s student at the Center for Data Science at New York University. Her research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and episodic memory—particularly in using data-driven methods to understand how humans remember and retell experiences. She is currently developing and evaluating LLM-based approaches for analyzing human recall and narrative structure.
