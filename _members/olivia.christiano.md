Liv earned her B.A. in Psychological Science from Central Connecticut State University, minoring in Biology & Philosophy, and her M.A. in Psychology with a focus on Cognition, Perception & Neuroscience from NYU. She is interested in the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval, with a particular focus on how attention and prior knowledge shape these processes in naturalistic contexts. If Liv's not in the lab, you can probably find her at the gym, walking her golden retriever, or drawing as she patiently waits for winter to come so she can go snowboarding.
