Liv earned her B.A. in Psychological Science from Central Connecticut State University, where she minored in Biology & Philosophy, and her M.A. in Psychology with a focus on Cognition, Perception & Neuroscience from NYU. She is interested in the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval, with a particular focus on how attention and prior knowledge shape these processes in naturalistic contexts. She is passionate about bridging technical methods and theoretical questions to better understand the dynamic interactions between cognition and memory.
