Nikita received his B.S. in Cognitive Science from UC Davis and his M.S. in Cognitive Neuroscience of Language from the Basque Centre on Cognition, Brain, and Language, Spain, where he worked on extending the feature and phoneme inventories of the TRACE model with Jim Magnuson. Before coming to NYU, he completed a predoctoral fellowship at the Proaction Lab in the University of Coimbra, Portugal, where he worked with high-level vision. He is interested in understanding the neural basis of perception and memory, how these processes interact and affect each other, how those interactions modulate our decisions, and how can we use this knowledge to build more human-like machines. Besides science, he enjoys drawing, playing guitar, hiking, and chatting with his vocal cat about how bored he was while Nikita was at work.
