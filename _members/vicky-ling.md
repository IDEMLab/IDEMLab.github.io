Vicky is currently an undergraduate student at New York University, majoring in Language and Mind with minors in Communicative Science and Disorders (CSD) and French. Her research and academic interests focus on the neural basis of speech perception and production, and how these processes interact with the memory system. She aims to contribute to the development of neurolinguistically informed intervention models, bridging the gap between cognitive theory, clinical practice, and generative approaches to human cognition.
