Brian is an undergraduate student at NYU pursuing a B.A. in Psychology and Philosophy. He is interested in how people perceive and understand events in naturalistic contexts, particularly through event schemas. His other interests include concepts, causal reasoning, and explanations. Brian's research is driven by a curiosity about how we come to know the world and how knowledge is achieved through inquiry.
