Ricardo's current research asks how the brain enables the dynamic interaction of control and memory processes for goal-directed search of memory elements in naturalistic settings. For instance, when trying to recall a particular event (e.g., where have I seen this person?), the brain needs to balance persisting interrogating one event (e.g., during the commute to work?) versus inspecting another (e.g., maybe at the supermarket?) versus resorting to other strategies (e.g., the person was wearing scrubs, probably at my last hospital visit?), all of which taking place at a very fast timescale. To answer these questions, he uses behavioral experiments in combination with neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, MEG, EEG) and computational modelling.
