Hao is a first-year graduate student in Psychology at NYU. He earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University and was an exchange student at MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. His primary research interest lies in using computational approaches to understand how the brain works and the mechanisms behind cognitive behaviors. Specifically, he focuses on using neural network models to simulate human memory retrieval and learning, as well as optimizing information transfer between different memory systems. Additionally, Hao has explored interests in neural computation modeling based on fractal geometry/chaos theory, non-backpropagation-based neuron credit assignment, and computational social psychology through multi-agent RL simulations.
