Leonard’s research focuses on how humans form episodic memories for unique events while abstracting generalized schemas. He earned a master’s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience at Maastricht University, where he investigated how temporal context in narratives is encoded and stored in memory. Before joining NYU, he worked in Uri Hasson’s lab at Princeton, studying the neural mechanisms of speech in everyday conversations using deep neural networks. Currently, he aims to develop innovative methods to study episodic memory by combining experimental control with rich, real-life contextual stimuli.
