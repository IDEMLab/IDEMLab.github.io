MD received his BA in Psychology from NYU. His research and academic interests focus on the clinical and neural applications of memory. He is particularly interested in memory replay, especially how the brain reconstructs past experiences to support decision-making, spatial navigation, and emotional regulation. Outside of academia, MD enjoys making a bucket list of travel locations and exploring different cuisines.
