Zihan is a first-year PhD student investigating how episodic memory supports dynamic, real-time cognition in naturalistic settings. He explores the mechanisms by which our past experiences guide our understanding of the present, using a combination of behavioral experiments, eye tracking, and neuroimaging. This research builds on his prior work in emotional memory (with Dr. Elizabeth Goldfarb at Yale), emotion predictions (M.A., with Dr. Yuan Chang Leong at the University of Chicago), and visual perception (B.S., with Dr. Julie Golomb at The Ohio State University). Outside the lab, Zihan enjoys playing guitar, piano, road-tripping, and spending time with his cat.
