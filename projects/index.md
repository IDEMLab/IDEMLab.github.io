# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-brain" %}Research

Our lab investigates how general knowledge representations and unique memories interact on a fast timescale. We use electrophysiology (EEG, MEG, and intracranial EEG) combined with computational modeling and behavioral experiments to understand the neurophysiological mechanisms and the computational principles underlying such interactive dynamics of episodic memory.
